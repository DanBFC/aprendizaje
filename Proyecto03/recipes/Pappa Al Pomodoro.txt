'1 cup extra-virgin olive oil  plus extra for drizzling 1 large celery stalk  finely chopped 1 large carrot  finely chopped 1 onion  finely chopped 5 fresh basil leaves 1 loaf day old Tuscan or country-style bread  cut into small pieces 3 cups vegetable stock 1 (10-ounce) can peeled plum tomatoes  with juices Salt and freshly ground black pepper '
'In a large pot  heat the olive oil and throw in the celery  carrots  onions and basil Fry up the vegetables until soft  and add the bread Stir thoroughly until the bread has absorbed all the extra-virgin olive oil Add a few ladles of vegetable stock and continue to stir very well The vegetable stock helps to break down the bread  turning it into a soft  porridge-like consistency Add the remaining broth and let it reduce Add the peeled plum tomatoes including the juices and roughly break up tomatoes with the back of a wooden spoon Cook for an additional 10 minutes  making sure the pappa is dense  not soupy Taste and season with salt and pepper Let cool to room temperature and serve with a drizzle with the best extra-virgin olive oil you can find'
